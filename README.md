### Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by [ekzhang/rustpad](https://github.com/ekzhang/rustpad), which is a Rust-based (with a React-Typescript frontend) collaborative code editor. Many of the architectural choices I make follow those made in [ekzhang/rustpad](https://github.com/ekzhang/rustpad).
- My Haskell implementation of the Operational Transformation logic follows and was tested against the Rust implementation of Operational Transformation in [spebern/operational-transform-rs](https://github.com/spebern/operational-transform-rs), which is ported from the Javascript implementation [Operational-Transform/ot.js](https://github.com/Operational-Transformation/ot.js/).
- I've referenced [ohri-anurag/TwoFifty-Backend](https://github.com/ohri-anurag/TwoFifty-Backend) for building the WebSocket server for haskpad - it's a great example. 
- I'd like to thank the [r/haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) for helpful discussions.
